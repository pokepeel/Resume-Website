        <h1>Jake's Resume Website - About Page</h1>
        <p>My name is Jake, I am in my late 20s and enjoy mainly gaming and music, I have a degree in Video Game Technology (Programming) from University of the west of England.<br />
           I was origianlly home educated until age 16, where I decided I wanted to persue programming, at which point I went to college (Studied 1 year in Retail and 4 years in IT).<br />
            I currently work in the retail sector and in my spare time enjoy gaming, programming and talking to my friends online and meeting up with them when the opportunity arises.<br/>
            I also have an electric guitar and piano that I need to learn how to play better.
